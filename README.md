# Inventory-Management-System-Assignment
This repository is having all the codes in ipynb file with json files for making an Inventory Management system during ETG AI/ML Internship

##I created an inventory management system that utilises a NoSQL database.
### The user is asked to do the following:
Enter:
- 'a' to add a new product in inventory

- 'l' to list all products in inventory

- 'e' to edit a record

- 'd' to delete a product from inventory

- 'p' to Purchase

I had added a total of five features to each product.
1. Product Name
2. Brand Name 
3. Stock Availability
4. Price 
5. Date of Expiration
